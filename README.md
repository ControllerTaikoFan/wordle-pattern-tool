# wordle-pattern-tool
Generates a list of words that can be used to make Wordle patterns, inspired by Instagram reels of Wordles that happen to make a certain German symbol

Takes a 5-letter word and shows you the words you need to input in Wordle for it to make a certain pattern, the default is a smiley face. A solution is not guaranteed for every word, depending on the pattern.
To use, run main.py (requires Python 3)

To change the pattern, either change the pattern variable in main.py to make a pattern of your choosing, or use the line-by-line feature in the program to make a pattern line by line
A pattern is 5 characters, either a capital X or _, an X indicating a letter that should be marked (green or yellow) and a _ indicating a letter that shouldn't (gray)
